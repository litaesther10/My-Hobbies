    <h1>Workout</h1>
    <p>
      Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do
      for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health,
      help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and
      muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical
      activity gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as
      large an impact on your health as physical activity.
